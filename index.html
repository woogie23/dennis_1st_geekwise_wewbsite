                    <span>CHEETAH, POWERFUL HUNTERS!</span>
                    <p>Cheetah are solitary animals. Males and females are only seen together for mating purposes. The male is a solitary hunter, as is the female, but the female will hunt with her cubs to teach them. They are the only large cat whose claws do not retract. Because they are solitary hunters, they are subject to having their food stolen by packs of other animals, so they will not fight other predators for their prey, so as to not be injured and not be able to hunt,which coul lead to their starvation. </p>

                    <span>BIRDS FLY!</span>
                    <p>The Lilac Breasted Roller is one of the most colorful birds located in many parts of the African continent. The name is derived from the lilac colored breast and because the male  will "roll" while flying during mating season in attempt to attract mates.

                    <p>Elephants are structured in a  matriarchal society, with the elder female usually in charge of the herd. Several generations will live together with all the females helping to raise and protect the young. Adult males are only around for breeding purposes or are juveniles who will leave the herd when three to five years of age. Juveniles males will often travel in small bands until they attempt to attract their own breeding herds, and then they will often live solitary lives.</p>

                    <h2>Here's a little bit about me</h2>
                    <p>I've been retired for a few years now, after starting out as a very young person and working my way through all kinds of stuff that happen in life. After a long and storied professional career, it has been very satisfying to  become very involved in Photography, and to return back to school, just for the sake of learning new things that interest me. "The Hunt for Red October" has been my favorite movie for many years, I need to sit down and enjoy it again soon. My favorite food or dinner would likely be Porkchops with mashed potatoes and gravy, just because it is comforting an tastes so good. Don't tell anyone, but I think I may be a closet nerd, as learning nerdy things is more fun for me, more than I should let anyone else know.</p>
